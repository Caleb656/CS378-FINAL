    "I am currently studying Computer Science at Eastern Washington University. I am in my senior year and currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. When I am not learning about new technologies, I enjoy playing video games, reading, practicing guitar, and watching good TV shows and movies. The posts attached to this website will be about the good shows and movies I have watched recently.",
