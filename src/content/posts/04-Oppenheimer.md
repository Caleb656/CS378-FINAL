## Description

During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.

## Brief Review

Oppenheimer was a movie I was very excited for since the first trailer, and it lived up to expectations. This movie details the Manhattan Project, the project that created the first nuclear bomb. The movie is very dialogue heavy, but it is well written and engaging. The movie is also very well acted, with Cillian Murphy giving a great performance as Oppenheimer (I've liked everything Cillian Murphy has done recently). The movie is very slow paced, but I was never bored. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

> Rating: 10/10
