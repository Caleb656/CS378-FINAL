## Brief Review

Invincible is another anime I wasn't sure I would be too fond of, but the short season captivated me and left me wanting more. The soundtrack and animation were fantastic, but the story is what really shines. The first episode of this show started off a little bit slow, but towards the end of the episode something happens that sets the tone for the rest of the season. It is difficult to talk about any plot points of the story without spoiling the show, but I can say it is a violent, gorey, action packed superhero show with plot twists that will leave you speechless.

> Rating: 10/10
