## Brief Review

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is one of my favorite shows on Netflix. I am not normally a fan of anime, but I like the Cyberpunk genre and gave this show a shot. This show was only ten episodes long with no season two coming. I was disappointed to hear that at first, but I am happy they went with that direction after finishing the show. Every second of the show was action packed, the story was fantastic, plus, animation and the soundtrack were top tier. This is not the type of show people with a weak stomach could watch because of its gore and violence. However, if you can handle these elements, no other show will excite you and put you on an emotional rollercoaster like Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.

> Rating: 10/10
